Fill tree with sample tree with animation

Some kind of manipulation of the tree:
Make tree larger or smaller

Get rid of flickering green thing on drag

Maybe put border on focused input and fake node

Tell user about editing

Have sidebar or topbar thing and move around screen

Improve styling of buttons, maybe make them gray out when they can't be used
