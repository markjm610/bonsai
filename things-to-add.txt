Animation when you click on start from root

Fill tree with sample tree with animation

Some kind of manipulation of the tree:
Make tree larger or smaller

Get rid of flickering green thing on drag

Maybe put border on focused input and fake node

Tell user about editing

Have sidebar or topbar thing and move around screen

Gesture should be easier to use

Gesture needs to be disabled at certain points

Drag and drop is working from a blank child for some reason regardless of level
